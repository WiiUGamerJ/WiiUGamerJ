## Hii! I'm WiiUGamerJ (WGJ).
### I am an **autodidact amateur programmer** and UI/UX designer. I'm currently doing Godot games and apps while designing in Figma.

**🌎 Languages:** Spanish (native), English, and Catalan (native).

💁 **A little bit about me:** Since I was little I have been inteested in computing, which has led me to early learning about the basics of software and hardware, programming, etc.

😃 **Hobbies:** Basically everything related to tech, I like opening PCs, hacking consoles, trying new OS and custom roms, designing UIs, videogames and lots of other things.

💻 **Knowledge:** I know how to program in GDScript (Godot Engine's programming language), I have homebrewed various Nintendo and Sony consoles, graphic design and UI design on Figma...

Need any help or something? You can contact me sending me a dm on Discord (@wiiugamerj), or sending me an [email](mailto:wiiugamerj@gmail.com) (wiiugamerj@gmail.com)
