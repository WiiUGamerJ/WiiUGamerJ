## Hii! I'm WGJ (wiiugamerj).
### I am an amateur programmer and UI/UX designer. Doing Godot games/apps while designing in Figma.

**üåé Languages:** Spanish (native), English (fluent), and Catalan (native).

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Current projects:** I am currently programming Just Dance Fusion, a Just Dance fangame and ABBA Player, a minimalist music player for ABBA songs in Godot (not affiliated with ABBA). I also am doing some Behance projects about UI/UX, branding and photography.

üíª **Knowledge:** I know how to program in GDScript (Godot Engine's programming language), I have homebrewed various Nintendo and Sony consoles, graphic design and UI design on Figma... I basically like everything related to tech, opening PCs, hacking consoles, trying new OS and custom roms, designing UIs, videogames and lots of other things.

üíÅ **A bit more about me:** Since I was little I have been interested in computing, which has led me to early learning about the basics of software and hardware, programming, etc. For more info and projects I've made, you can [go to my portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/wiiugamerj) and [Behance profile](https://www.behance.net/wiiugamerj).
