## Hii! I'm WiiUGamerJ (WGJ).
### I am an **autodidact amateur programmer** and UI/UX designer. I'm currently working on a videogame made in Godot 4.

**🌎 Languages:** Spanish (native), English, and Catalan (native), but I'm learning French.

💁 **A little bit about me:** Since I was little I have been interested in computing, which has led me to early learning about the basics of software and hardware, programming, etc.

😃 **Hobbies:** Basically everything related to tech, I like mounting PCs, hacking consoles, trying new OS and custom roms, designing UIs, videogames and lots of other things.

💻 **Knowledge:** I know how to program in GDScript, Godot Engine's programming language, HTML, CSS, graphic design and UI design...
