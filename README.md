## Hello, I am WiiUGamerJ (WGJ).
### I am an **autodidact amateur programmer** and UI/UX designer. I'm currently working on a videogame made in Godot 4.

**I can fluently speak** Spanish, English, and Catalan, but I'm learning French.

Currently, I am learning GDScript, html, CSS, and UI/UX design. Since I was little I have been interested in computing, which has led me to early learning about the basics of software and hardware, programming, etc.
