## Hii! I'm WGJ (wiiugamerj).
### I am an amateur programmer and UI/UX designer. Doing Godot games/apps while designing in Figma.

**🌎 Languages:** Spanish, English, and Catalan.

ℹ️ **Current projects:** I am currently programming Just Dance Fusion, a Just Dance fangame and ABBA Player, a minimalist music player for ABBA (not affiliated with ABBA). I also am doing some Behance projects about UI/UX, branding and photography.

💻 **Knowledge:**
- GDScript
- Figma UI/UX design
- MacOS, Windows and Debian Linux
- Unlocking phones' bootloader and _custom romming_
- Nintendo and Play Station homebrew scene I have homebrewed various Nintendo and Sony consoles, graphic design and UI design on Figma... I basically like everything related to tech, opening PCs, hacking consoles, trying new OS and custom roms, designing UIs, videogames and lots of other things.

💁 **A bit more about me:** Since I was little I have been interested in computing, which has led me to early learning about the basics of software and hardware, programming, etc. For more info and projects I've made, visit my portfolio.
